rstblog -- a static site generator with blogging support
========================================================

I maintain a `fork <https://github.com/sa2ajj/rstblog>`_ of `rstblog
<https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_.

There was a number of changes that I do not think useful enough to be merged
upstream.  However if I feel that some of the changes are worth spreading, pull
requests will be due...

TODO
----

* make the search working (yes, there's a search field to the right, but it
  does not really work)
* automatic posting to `twitter <http://twitter.com>`_ of new articles with
  proper tags
* add `disqus <http://disqus.com/>`_ support, so you could comment on articles
  that you find interesting
* automatic posting to `Livejournal <http://livejournal.com>`_ of new articles

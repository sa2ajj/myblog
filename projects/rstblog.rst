rstblog -- a static site generator with blogging support
========================================================

I maintain a `fork <https://github.com/sa2ajj/rstblog>`_ of `rstblog
<https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_.

There was a number of changes that I do not think useful enough to be merged
upstream.  However if I feel that some of the changes are worth spreading, pull
requests will be due...

This package is about managing authz files as understood by mod_authz_svn --
authorization module for subversion[1] repositories served via apache.

Currently the package contains two utilities:

  authz-tool  -- a tool for extracting and modifying information in a authz
                 file from command line
  authz-admin -- a cgi script to help maintaining authz files.  it should be
                 useful for the situations where you have numerous repositories
                 served with help of SVNParentPath directive (see mod_dav_svn
                 module documentation)

INSTALLATION

So far the package was only tried on a Debian system with python2.4 (no, the
application does not use any 2.4 specific stuff).  The installation looks as
simple as that:

  python setup.py install

You must make sure that you have python2.4-dev package installed beforehand.

After the command finishes, you will find the following files installed:

  /usr/lib/python2.4/site-package/AuthZFile.py
  /usr/bin/authz-tool
  /usr/bin/authz-admin
  /usr/share/authz-tools/authz-admin.tmpl

USAGE

  authz-tool

    Its usage is pretty simple:

      authz-tool <authzfile> <operation> [<arg>]

    Where operation is one of the following:

    getgroups
      dumps the content of [groups] section to the standard output

    setgroups
      replaces the contents of the [groups] section with what is given on the
      standard input. if the input does not have a [groups] section, the
      [groups] section in the specified file will be removed

    get <repo>
      dump all sections that are related to the specified repository

    set <repo>
      replaces all sections for the specified repository with what is given on
      the standard input. the input is going to be checked and only appropriate
      sections will be put in the file

    del <repo>
      removes all sections related to the specified repository

    NOTE: for the operations with repositories, you may specify '' (empty
    string) as a repository name

  authz-admin

    authz-admin is a CGI script that allows modification of an authz file

    It can be used in two essentially different ways:
      -- there are no restrictions accessing the script
      -- user must be authenticated to access the script

    Installation (Common Part)

      copy the script to /usr/lib/cgi-bin
      modify three variables at the very beginning of the file:
        authz_file -- authz file you'd like to maintain
        template_file -- template that is part of this package
        script_alias -- relative URL through which the script is accessible
                        on your web server (if you copy the script to
                        /usr/lib/cgi-bin, you do not have to change it)
      make sure the script is exectuable: chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/authz-admin
      make sure that the authz file is writable for the user under which web
      server is running:
        in case of Debian:
          chown www-data:www-data /path/to/authz/file
          chmod u+w /path/to/authz/file

      if necessary limit access to the script (instructions will be provided
        later)

      point your browser to http://your-host.example.org/cgi-bin/authz-admin

    Restricted Access

      When run script checks if the user had to authenticate herself.  If yes,
      then the script will perform additional checks to see if the user can
      perform certain operations. The rights are granted by adding user to the
      special groups (these must be defined in [groups] section):

        authz-admin-<super>
          only users from this group can modify [groups] section

        authz-admin-<global>
          users from this group can modify all non qualified paths (sections
          that are named like [/path])

        authz-admin-repo
          users from this group can modify paths for the specific repo
          (sections that are named like [repo:/path])

      So to restrict certain operations to specific users you'd have to do the
      following (for apache):

        add to the configuration file a section like

          <Location /cgi-bin/authz-admin>
            AuthType  Basic
            AuthName  "Editing Authz File"
            AuthFileName  /path/to/htpasswd/file
            Require valid-user
          </Location>

        add to [groups] section of your authz file at least the following line

          authz-admin-<super> = yourusername

        restart apache and here you are

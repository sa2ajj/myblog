New Blog
========

I always wanted to post something using `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ and I became somewhat envious when
`Octopress <http://octopress.org/>`_ appeared on the radar.

The reason is very simple: for documenting various things related to internal
projects I was part of, we used `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, so many
formatting things became more than natural (automatic).

For more than 10 years I've been maintaining `LiveJournal blog
<http://mss.livejournal.com/>`_, however lately it became rather unreliable.
And while many of my LJ friends moved to `Dreamwidth
<http://www.dreamwidth.org/>`_, I did not feel that it is right for me since
again it did not allow to use *reStructuredText* to write the posts.

Suddenly, `Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com/>`_ had a link to an
`article <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3379962>`_ that turned to be part
of a blog that is maintained in *reStructuredText* using a tool called `rstblog
<https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_. I was thrilled and had cloned the code
so it could become a bit more suitable for me.  The result is described at
`my rstblog </projects/rstblog.html>`_ page.

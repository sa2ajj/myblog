Miscelanous Changes
===================

Life goes on and sometimes it's quite difficult to keep up with it.

From the 1st of August I do not work for `Nokia <http://nokia.com>`_ any more.

Some time ago we started from "scratch" our life with my ex-wife.  From one
hand, it's a totally new experience -- we do make things that make the other
one feel special, from the other, sometimes it feels "don't we just try to make
the other one feel good?"...

Anyway, I moved from Matinkyla to Olari: it does not sound to be too far away,
while some shops -- especially, K Citymarket -- are missed indeed.

This blog's "design" was updated to the latest version of `Twitter's Bootstrap
<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_.  At the same time a few
simplifications of the layout took place.

`Adobe <http://adobe.com>`_ added two fonts -- ``Source Sans Pro`` and ``Source
Code Pro`` -- which I'm happily using on this site via `TypeKit
<https://typekit.com/>`_.  (I hope that all necessary places were updated :))

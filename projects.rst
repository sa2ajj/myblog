Projects
========

These days I write mostly in Python and Erlang.

Active Projects
---------------

`edeblib <projects/edeblib.html>`_
    an Erlang library to work with Debian files

Semi-Active Projects
--------------------

`egpgme <https://github.com/sa2ajj/egpgme>`_
    a NIF module for interfacing Erlang and GPGME.

    Currently, on hold since I came to realization that using NIF might be not
    exactly right approach here.

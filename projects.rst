Projects
========

These days I write mostly in Python and Erlang.

Active Projects
---------------

`edeblib <projects/edeblib.html>`_
    an Erlang library to work with Debian files

`rstblog <projects/rstblog.html>`_
    a static site generator with blogging support

Semi-Active Projects
--------------------

`egpgme <https://github.com/sa2ajj/egpgme>`_
    a NIF module for interfacing Erlang and GPGME.

    Currently, on hold since I came to realization that using NIF might be not
    exactly right approach here.

Inactive Projects
-----------------

`pam-realm </projects/pam-realm>`_
    control you realms

    This project served its purpose back in 2002.   However lately there seem
    to be little use in it.

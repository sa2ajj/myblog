My name is Mikhail Sobolev (Михаил Соболев).  I was born in Russia
(St.Petersburg) and now live in Finland (Espoo).

I currently work for `Nokia <http://nokia.com>`_.

The area of my work is distributed build systems.  The most actively used
system is BIFH -- `Beloved Integration Friendly Helper
<http://sa2ajj.mawhrin.net/tags/bifh/>`_ -- a system written in Python that
uses a number of tools:

* `RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_
* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
* `MySQL <http://mysql.com/>`_
* `Scratchbox <http://scratchbox.org/>`_
* `Debian <http://www.debian.org/>`_
